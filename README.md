## Usage
​To use this Woo-Shop back-end sever, the dependencies must first be installed (refer to section above). Once this is done, the user will run the following command " node server.js ". The user will then use Insomnia Core to test the servers API routes. In Insomnia Core the user will select a http request (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE) with the appropriate url endpoint and the appropriate request body models for each api route file.
